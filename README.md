# COSO - the exploring thingy

A simple ruby pet project.  

An area gets generated with a spawn point, an exit and some obstacles. The
explorer must then traverse the area looking for the exit.  

There's no reason behind this other that I want to find out how well I can
make this thing work.  

I also wonder how long I will actively work on this.  


### Run the thingy  
Step 1: install dependencies via bundler  
```
bundle install
```

Step 2: start everything via rake  
```
bundle exec rake
```
