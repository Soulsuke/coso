TODO:  
 - render a status message (exploring, exited, stuck)  
 - stop drawing the explorer once it has exited (on both maps)  
 - render the current number of ticks  
 - do not redraw anything when exited or stuck  
 - change explored true/false to explored datetime, and pick the one with the
   min time when moving  
 - make the explorer smarter: use a compass to find unexplored tiles  
 - implement a real maze solving solution, aiming for a dustom algorithm with
   a decent performance
